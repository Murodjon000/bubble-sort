# Bubble sort algorithm

The `#bubble_sort` method takes in an `array` as an `argument` and returns the sorted `array`. For example:

```ruby
p bubble_sort(%w[5, 6, 1, 8, 6])
# => [1, 5, 6, 6, 8]
```

The `#bubble_sort_by` method takes in an `array` as an `argument`, and a `block`, and returns the sorted `array`. For example:

```ruby
p bubble_sort_by(%w[human cat volcano]) { |arg_1, arg_2| arg_1.length - arg_2.length }
# => ["cat", "human", "volcano"]
```
